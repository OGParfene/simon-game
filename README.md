This repositry contains an website with the classing Simon Game.

HOW GAME WORKS
There are 4 different buttons with different colours and initialy you have to press any key to start the game and when you do it you start at level 1, where you will be given a random sequence by the computer.
Afterwards you have to click on the buttons on the order that the sequence has been given. If you complete it succesfully you will pass to another level.
On each level you have to start the sequence from 0, from the first button you have pressed and afterwards you have to concatenate the new button to the sequence.
If you press a button in a wrong order the game will show a GAME OVER message and the game will start from the beggining.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
This game has been made by me while i was learning a Full Stack Web Developing curse and was made to test my habilities and my knowledge on JavaScript using jQuery selector.

Thank you for reading and enjoy.
